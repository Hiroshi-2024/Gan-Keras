# Keras-GAN

## About
Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models. Since I don't have access to a computer
with a GPU the models will be limited in their complexity and fast training times will be prioritized.
This repository is created for a self-educational purpose.

## Implementations 
### ACGAN
