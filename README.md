# Keras-GAN

## About
Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models. Since I don't have access to a computer
with a GPU the models will be limited in their complexity and short training sessions will be prioritized.

## Implementations 
### ACGAN
Implementation of the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network.
